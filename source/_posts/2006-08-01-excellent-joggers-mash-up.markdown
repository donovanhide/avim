[Gmaps Pedometer](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/) is undoubtedly the most useful application of Google Maps I have come across. You can calculate the distance you have just jogged and plot your route on a pretty map. Saves carrying a pedometer or a GPS! Simple to use, click "Start Recording" and then *Double-Click* for each of the vertices of your route. Brilliant!
