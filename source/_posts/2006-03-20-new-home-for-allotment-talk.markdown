I've been neglecting this blog of late, but promise to update soon with plenty of C# musings. In the meantime I'd like to draw your attention to the new location of my musings on allotments. [Here](http://www.secretallotment.co.uk) you'll find myself and other plotholders tracking the progress of their plantings throughout the year. See you there!
