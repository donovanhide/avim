I have a great amount of respect for someone who has an idea that's so good that they can sit back and watch the money roll itself in. [The Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com) is a great example. Good idea, great use of eBay and it's associated media machine and a simple self-explanatory, self-promoting domain name. I bet Alex nervously enjoyed this auction like no other! Behind all the hype though, it did actually take 6 months to sell all the pixels. Have a look at first posting [here](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/blog.php).

Anyway, in my everlasting quest to find permanent employment I found [this advert](http://www.freelancers.net/freelance-projects/200602/8938.html). This sort of opportunity makes you want to learn a new language, choosing C# and .Net does limit your options to some degree.
