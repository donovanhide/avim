Heard [here](http://www.torchbox.com/blog/libyan_domain_names.html) that domains ending in .ly where available from the [Libyan Registrar](http://nic.ly) so thought I might investigate. [Libyan Spider](http://libyanspider.com/lydomains.php) seemed like the most respectable agent, although at $149.50/year, they are not cheap.

It was quite a lot of fun searching all the short words ending in 'ly', and believe me, there are quite a few left! I ended up going for:

* **[rap.id.ly](http://rap.id.ly)**
* **[luc.id.ly](http://luc.id.ly)**
* **[viv.id.ly](http://viv.id.ly)**

and

* **[app.ly](http://app.ly)**

If you are interested in lightening me of one of these domains, then feel free to comment!
